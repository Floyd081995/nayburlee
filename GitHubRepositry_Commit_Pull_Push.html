Sure! Here’s a simple explanation and a cheat sheet for you:

## **Explain Like I’m 10**

Imagine you and your friends are building a LEGO city together.  
You don’t want to mess up the city while you’re building a new house, so you build your house on a separate table first.  
When your house is ready and looks good, you show it to your friends.  
If everyone likes it, you add it to the city!

- **Feature branch:** Your own table to build something new.
- **Commit:** Take a picture of your progress so you don’t lose it.
- **Push:** Share your picture with your friends.
- **Pull request:** Ask your friends if you can add your house to the city.
- **Merge:** Add your house to the city when everyone agrees.

## **Git Cheat Sheet for Teams**

### **1. Start a New Feature**

git checkout -b feature/my-new-thing
```

### **2. Work and Save Progress**

git commit -m "Describe what you did"
git push origin feature/my-new-thing
```

### **3. Open a Pull Request**
- Go to GitHub.
